# Coca-Cola Revenue & Margin Driver Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the key drivers behind Coca-Cola’s revenue growth and operating margin trends over the past decade. The goal was to understand how structural changes, pricing power, and cost discipline shaped profitability over time, and to build intuition for forecasting and valuation work.

This analysis is backward-looking and diagnostic, focusing on explaining what changed and why, rather than estimating causal effects through econometric modeling.

## Key Questions
- What drove Coca-Cola’s reported revenue decline prior to 2019?

- How did refranchising impact margins and cost structure?

- Was post-COVID growth driven by volume or pricing?

- How did inflation and reinvestment affect margins between 2022–2024?

## Methodology
- Collected 10 years of historical financial data (2015–2024) from public company filings and Macrotrends

- Analyzed revenue growth, gross margin, SG&A leverage, and EBIT margin trends

- Interpreted performance using a combination of financial statement analysis, timing of structural changes, and management disclosures

No statistical regressions were used; the focus was on applied financial analysis and business interpretation.

## Key Findings
- Revenue declines from 2015–2018 were driven primarily by the refranchising of bottling operations rather than demand weakness

- Refranchising structurally improved margins and reduced operating complexity, resulting in higher gross and EBIT margins

- Post-2020 revenue growth was largely price/mix-led, demonstrating strong pricing power amid inflationary pressures

- Margin compression in 2022–2024 reflected commodity inflation and deliberate reinvestment in marketing and capabilities, not deterioration in the underlying business
